# RPRoguelike
This is mostly a learning project, I don't really have anything to contribute to the genre. The idea behind this is to provide a fairly standard roguelike game, but with a few more RPG elements than you'd typically see in the genre.

# Build Instructions
I'm gonna be real with you here, chief I legit have no clue. If you're on windows and use visual studio, then you could probably just open up the Solution file and click the build and run button. However, beyond that I can't help. I'll try to figure something out later.
